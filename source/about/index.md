Translating...

I used to persuaded others to open a personal blog for many times, and now I started a blog myself.

Of course blog is a place to put aritcals on. I've writen several, most of them haven't been published yet. After this blog established, I will put many of my stuffs on, which contains some technical blog or some essay. But it's hard to tell. You know this is only a beginning, after all.

When I was a child, I wasn't like writing very much. my When my primary school assigned diary homework to me, I scribbled it causually, gather around 200 Chinese characters (around 60 words), then account for it. I suspect that my skill of talking nonsense was practiced at that time. Besides, when composition homework have been assigned, I nearly crazy. Sriking hair, sharpened pencil hoverd one centimeter above off the paper, I throught desperately what should be writen. Hours passed and the manuscript paper remained blank. Once I delayed for several hours, then forced me to write. After few months this arctical had been posted on a small local newspaper's *Students Arcitcal* column. My parents showed a brand-new ten yuan note (Chinese currency), telling that's my royalties.
